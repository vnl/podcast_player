					<description><![CDATA[<p>Another episode in the way back machine with Jerry and Curt. Over the past decade or so, research within the field of behavioral health has given rise to a wide variety of evidence-based practices. Characterizing and legitimately testing the effects of treatments has been a significant positive direction for behavioral health.  However, notably missing from this literature are investigations of factors related to individuals who did not appear to benefit from the interventions.  Understanding individual differences may contribute valuable information about how and when interventions are most likely to be effective.</p>

<p>The first podcast in a series focused on the relationship between heart rate variability and trauma, we introduce the concept and provide some initial insights. In 2015, the Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology published a unique special issue dedicated to the idea of implementing physiological measures into the assessment of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent behavioral health.  The issue included several articles demonstrating how this can be done.  We start a multi-episode show to share some literature, examples, and issues with using physiology in our assessment and understanding of some of the impacts of exposure to adverse childhood experiences.</p>
